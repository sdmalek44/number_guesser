# number_guesser 
  
### Summary  

The point of this project was to create a number guesser game using only javascript for game logic. The game  
was created entirely on the front end. A random number within a certain range is generated and the user can  
guess what the number is. When the user makes a guess, the game will prompt the user that his or her guess  
is too high or low and they can guess again. When the user gets the number correct the answer is changed and  
the range of possible numbers is increased. The user also has the ability to set the range themselves.
